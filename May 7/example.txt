Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models in natural language processing. By integrating a retrieval mechanism with a generative model, RAG can access and utilize external information to enhance the accuracy and relevance of its outputs. This method is particularly useful in tasks that require up-to-date or specific information, such as question answering, document summarization, and dialogue systems. RAG leverages a pre-trained retriever to fetch relevant documents or passages from a large corpus, which are then used by the generative model to produce more informed and contextually accurate responses. This dual approach not only improves the quality of the generated text but also ensures that the information is grounded in real-world data.
