#  Python Mini Projects â€“ Week 1

## May 5
This repository includes three beginner-friendly Python programs for practice in GUI and console-based applications using Python.

###  1. Simple Calculator (Tkinter GUI)

A basic calculator that supports arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

**Features:**
- Built using `tkinter`.
- Input validation (handles empty or invalid input).
- Real-time result display.
- Colorful and clean GUI.

**How to Run:**
```bash
python calculator.py
```
 ### 2. Number Guessing Game (Tkinter GUI)
A fun number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

**Features:**
- Random number generation.
- Feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
- Tracks the number of attempts.
- Handles invalid (non-numeric) inputs.
- Option to start a new game.

**How to Run:**
```bash
python guessing_game.py
```
###3. Fibonacci Sequence Generator
A program that generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms.

**Features:**
- User input for number of terms.
- Validates positive integer input.
- Generates and displays the Fibonacci sequence.

**How to Run:**
```bash
python fibonacci.py
```

### 1. Palindrome Checker
This project implements a program that checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
**Features:**
- Checks if the input string is a palindrome.
- Handles both string and numeric inputs.
- Ignores spaces, punctuation, and case when checking for a palindrome.
**How to Run:**
  ```bash
  python palindrome.py
  ```
### 2. Login System
This project implements a simple login system using Python. Users can register and log in with a username and password. The system stores user credentials in a local file and verifies the login details upon login attempt.
**Features:**
- Allows users to register with a username and password.
- Saves user credentials securely in a file.
- Allows users to log in using the username and password.
**How to Run:**
  ```bash
  python login.py
  ```
  ### 2. Temperature Converter
This project converts temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides an easy-to-use interface to enter a temperature and choose the desired conversion unit.
**Features:**
- Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
- Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
- Converts Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.
**How to Run:**
  ```bash
  python temperature.py
  ```
