- Input validation (handles empty or invalid input).
- Real-time result display.
- Colorful and clean GUI.

**How to Run:**
```bash
python calculator.py
```
 ### 2. Number Guessing Game (Tkinter GUI)
A fun number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

**Features:**
- Random number generation.
- Feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
- Tracks the number of attempts.
- Handles invalid (non-numeric) inputs.
- Option to start a new game.

**How to Run:**
```bash
python guessing_game.py
```
###3. Fibonacci Sequence Generator
A program that generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified number of terms.

**Features:**
- User input for number of terms.

### 1. Palindrome Checker

This project implements a program that checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

**Features:**
- Checks if the input string is a palindrome.
- Handles both string and numeric inputs.
- Ignores spaces, punctuation, and case when checking for a palindrome.

**How to Run:**

  ```bash
  python palindrome.py
  ```
### 2. Login System

This project implements a simple login system using Python. Users can register and log in with a username and password. The system stores user credentials in a local file and verifies the login details upon login attempt.

**Features:**
- Allows users to register with a username and password.
- Saves user credentials securely in a file.
- Allows users to log in using the username and password.

**How to Run:**

  ```bash
  python login.py
  ```
### 3. Temperature Converter

This project converts temperature values between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides an easy-to-use interface to enter a temperature and choose the desired conversion unit.

**Features:**
- Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
- Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
- Converts Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

**How to Run:**

  ```bash
  python temperature.py
  ```

### 1. Word Frequency Counter

This GUI app reads a text file and counts how often each word appears.

**Features:**
- GUI input for file name.
- Reads file content and counts word frequency.
- Displays result in the GUI.

**How to Run:**

  ```bash
  python word_frequency.py
  ```
### 2. User Input Save & Read 

This app allows users to input text and a file name, then saves the input to the file and reads it back.

**Features:**
- Enter custom file name and content.
- Save input to a file.

**Features:**
- Add, search, and delete contacts.
- View all contacts.
- Data stored persistently using a JSON file.
- Clean GUI built with tkinter.

**How to Run:**
